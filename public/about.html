    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hi, Dharen, a Web Developer and a recent graduate from the University of British Columbia. I have a passion for creating beautiful and functional websites that meet the needs of the users and the clients. I have experience in using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like Bootstrap and React to build responsive and interactive web pages. I also have some knowledge of back-end technologies, such as PHP, Node.js, and MongoDB.</p>
    <p>During my studies, I completed several web development projects, both individually and as part of a team. Some of the projects that I'm most proud of are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="^1^">Portfolio Website</a>: A personal website that showcases my skills and projects.</li>
      <li><a href="^2^">Todo App</a>: A simple but functional todo app that uses React and Firebase.</li>
      <li><a href="^3^">Weather App</a>: A weather app that displays the current weather and forecast for any city in the world, using the OpenWeather API.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Thank you for visiting my website and for your interest in my work. If you want to get in touch with me, you can email me at delarosa.dharnem@gmail.com or connect with me on LinkedIn.</p>
